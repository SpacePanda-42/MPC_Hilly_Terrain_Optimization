# MPC_Hilly_Terrain_Optimization

This project aims to generate optimal trajectories for a car between a start and goal point on simulated hilly terrain using a model predictive control (MPC) framework. By varying a weight parameter, the trajectory will more heavily optimize for either fuel consumption or travel time. To generate a trajectory, run the working_MPC_with_lyapunov.py file in the scripts folder. See the MPC_Hilly_Terrain_Optimization.pdf for results and more details on implementation.
